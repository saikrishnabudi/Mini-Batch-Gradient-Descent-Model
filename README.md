# Mini-Batch-Gradient-Descent-Model

Mini-Batch Gradient Descent Model for Neural Networks

In Mini-Batch Gradient Descent Model we can change the Batch Size is 32 and also we can change it into 64, 128...

Here, we can able to see that there is a High accuray in the model.

While compare to the other models â–¶ (https://github.com/saikrishnabudi/Stochastic-Gradient-Descent-Model), We get the best accuracy for the Mini-Batch Gradient Descent Model.

By changing & modifying the different hyperparameters we will able to pushup our accuracy in the model.
